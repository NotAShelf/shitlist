This is a list of lists to list software that I think should be listed on
various lists. Namely, it is a static site built with Astro for curating and
categorizing various tech opinions and experiences. They are all objectively
correct, of course.

You may consider this list of lists a lovingly crafted rundown of tech that's
made me want to throw my keyboard out the window, complete with why these tools
and languages deserve a spot in my personal hall of shame. Buckle your fuckle,
because shit will go down.
