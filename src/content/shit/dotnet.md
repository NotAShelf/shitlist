## Overview

.NET is a software development platform developed by Microsoft, supporting
multiple programming languages, libraries, and tools for building a wide range
of applications. While it has enabled the creation of many robust enterprise and
desktop solutions, .NET has also faced criticism for its complexity, tooling,
and ecosystem quirks.

## Rant

- Microsoft. That's it, that's the rant.
- XML infests everything, ugly and verbose, a parsing hellscape.
- Build and CI tools are a sobbing disaster. MSBuild is a sadistic prank.
- Compiled but still needs a runtime... Grow up already.
- DevOps basics like versioning or git hooks? Missing or barely there.
- Took until v7.0 for sane string literals or container smarts---embarrassing!
- Passing auth credentials is a soul-sucking slog through API purgatory.
- Project files are hostile robot scribbles, not human-friendly.
- NuGet's a lawless mess. People package ancient NuGet versions or jQuery hacks.
- Debugging performance is like groping in the dark with a spoon.
- Visual Studio is a memory-hogging monolith that crashes more than it should.
- LINQ pretends to be functional but just masks imperative spaghetti.
- Windows-centric by default, Linux support is an afterthought held together
  with duct tape.

## Verdict

.NET is a bloated enterprise tax dressed up as a development platform. The
"cross-platform" claim is a joke that took two decades to stop being funny.
Every improvement comes decades after every other ecosystem figured it out
first. The verbosity, the XMLCancer, the runtime dependency, the package
ecosystem that puts npm to shame in the worst ways---this is legacy tech that
refuses to die. If you're starting a new project and someone suggests .NET, run.
